    - **COD** (Chemical Oxygen Demand): A measure of the amount of oxygen
             required to oxidize organic and inorganic compounds in water.
    - **BOD** (Biological Oxygen Demand): A related metric showing oxygen
             demand from biological processes.
    - **TN** (Total Nitrogen): Total amount of nitrogen, important for nutrient
             loading and treatment.
    - **Coagulants**: Chemicals used to remove solids and organics from water
             in the treatment process.
    - **Outflow/Inflow**: The volume of water leaving or entering the treatment
             system.
    - **Feature Importance**: A score showing how much a variable contributes
             to predicting COD levels.

    The dataset represents operational and environmental data from a full-scale
    wastewater treatment plant.
    It includes:
    - Water quality measures (COD, BOD, TN, etc.)
    - Weather data (temperature, rainfall, wind)
    - Plant inflow and outflow volumes
